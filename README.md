# c-call-rust-onnx-infer

This repository provides a demonstration code for invoking Rust functionality from C to implement ONNX model inference. The primary purpose is to showcase the seamless integration of Rust into a C codebase for efficient ONNX model inferencing.

For a comprehensive understanding of the project and detailed insights into the implementation, please refer to the associated [blog post](https://easy-ai.org/2024/03/c%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8rust-onnx%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B/).
